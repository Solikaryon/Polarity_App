# Polarity_App
Polarity Check is a desktop application that automates the creation of polarity verification reports for SMT production lines. It processes FeederSetup.csv files and generates a structured, print-ready Excel report with component data, job information, and embedded polarity images, reducing manual work and standardizing quality documentation.
